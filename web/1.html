<br><br>Ancient Egyptian literature was written in the 
Egyptian language from<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/common-dom-interfaces.html#htmlcollection-0" target="blank" title="html 5 specification"> Ancient Egypt's pharaonic 
period </a>until the end of Roman domination. Along with Sumerian
 <p style="margin-top:100px;">literature, it is considered the world's earliest literature.
 Writing in Ancient Egypt (sample pictured) first appeared in the l
 ate 4th millennium BC. By the Old Kingdom, literary works included 
 funerary texts, epistles and letters, religious hymns and poems, and 
 commemorative autobiographical texts.<img src="desert.jpg" width="100%"> Middle Egyptian, the spoken language
  of the Middle Kingdom, became a classical language preserving a narrative
   Egyptian literature during the New Kingdom, when Late Egyptian first appeared 
   in writing.</p> Scribes of the New Kingdom canonized and copied many literary texts
    written in Middle Egyptian, which remained the language used for oral readings 
    of sacred hieroglyphic texts. Ancient Egyptian literature has been preserved on
     papyrus scrolls and packets, limestone and ceramic ostraca, wooden writing boards, monumental stone edifices, and coffins.
